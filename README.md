# Python-Basics-Data-Science
Hi :blush:. In this repository, I'll be sharing my journey with learning python for Data Science. I hope you find it helpful too. I'll be attaching a JuPyter Notebook file.
### The toics that will be covered here include:
String Operations, List and Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets, Conditions and Branching, Loops, Functions, Reading Files, Pandas, NumPy, DataFrames, Data Visualisation, Data Cleaning, etcetera.

I'll suggest a comprehensive yet simple way to go about it by dividing my journey into groups. This will help you navigate your way semlessly 😁. Do not forget to reach for, or learn from other materials.
I have put this up as a guide so you do not have to encounter many hassles with respect to Python for Data Science "roadmap" 🤝🫶.
